        <div class="Section" id="s1"> <p><b>WATER</b></p>
            <p>A colorless, transparent, odorless liquid that forms the seas, lakes, rivers, and rain and is the basis of the fluids of living organisms. <br> 
                The liquid that descends from the clouds as rain, forms streams, lakes, and seas, and is a major constituent of all living matter and that when pure is an odorless, tasteless, very slightly compressible liquid oxide of hydrogen H2O.</p>

        <div class="Section" id="s2"> <p><B>BED</B></p>
            <p>A piece of furniture for sleep or rest, typically a framework with a mattress and coverings. <br>
                Most modern beds consist of a soft, cushioned mattress on a bed frame. The mattress rests either on a solid base, often wood slats, or a sprung base.</p>

        <div class="Section" id="s3"> <p><b>HOUSE</b></p>
            <p>A building for human habitation, especially one that is lived in by a family or small group of people. <br>
                Home is a safe haven and a comfort zone. A place to live with our families and pets and enjoy with friends. A place to build memories as well as a way to build future wealth. A place where we can truly just be ourselves.</p>
